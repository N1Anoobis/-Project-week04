    <h1>Bobby McFerrin</h1>
    <h2>Don't Worry Be Happy</h2>
    <p>Here's a little song I wrote
        You might want to sing it note for note
        Don't worry, be happy
        In every life we have some trouble
        But when you worry you make it double
        Don't worry, be happy
        Don't worry, be happy now
        don't worry
        (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) be happy
        (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) don't worry, be happy
        (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) don't worry
        (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) be happy
        (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) don't worry, be happy
        </p>
